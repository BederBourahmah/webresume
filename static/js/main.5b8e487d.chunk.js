This is the fastest in the industry and requires their technicians to be adept at problem solving and troubleshooting electronics. At my first annual performance evaluation I was promoted to Field Service Technician II due to my exceptional throughput, attention to detail, and ability to master complex business processes. This promotion typically requires two years of experience as a Field Service Technician I. I continued to develop my technical expertise as a Field Service Technician II while mentoring new technician hires. Around the time of my second annual review I was approached by leadership within my organization regarding my interest in pursuing a career on the leadership track. After careful consideration, I communicated my interest in pursuing a leadership role within SEL. Within the next few months I was promoted to an Associate Field Service Supervisor. Almost immediately after my promotion I requested an assignment to start a branch of my department in our Lewiston, Idaho manufacturing facility. My assignment was approved and within a few months I had completed that project. During this time, my manager expanded my responsibilities to include supervision of Production Troubleshooting in the Lewiston facility. Production Troubleshooting is the department responsible for root cause analysis and repair of devices failing production testing."))}}]),a}(r.a.Component)),C=function(e){function a(){return Object(s.a)(this,a),Object(l.a)(this,Object(m.a)(a).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(d.a)(a,e),Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement(N.a,null,r.a.createElement(u.a,{className:"App-navbar"},r.a.createElement(N.b,{className:"App-navLinks",to:"/"},r.a.createElement(h.a,null,"Beder's Web Resume")),r.a.createElement(p.a,{className:"NavigationBar-items"},r.a.createElement(N.b,{className:"App-navLinks",to:"/education"},r.a.createElement(f.a,null,"Education")),r.a.createElement(N.b,{className:"App-navLinks",to:"/career"},r.a.createElement(f.a,null,"Career")),r.a.createElement(b.a,{inNavbar:!0},r.a.createElement(E.a,{nav:!0,caret:!0,className:"App-navLinks"},"Downloads"),r.a.createElement(y.a,{right:!0,className:"App-dropdownMenu"},r.a.createElement(v.a,{href:w.a,target:"_blank",className:"App-navLinks"},"Resume"),r.a.createElement(v.a,{href:S.a,target:"_blank",className:"App-navLinks"},"Cover Letter"))))),r.a.createElement(k.c,null,r.a.createElement(k.a,{path:"/education"},r.a.createElement(O,null)),r.a.createElement(k.a,{path:"/career"},r.a.createElement(j,null))))}}]),a}(r.a.Component),F=function(){return r.a.createElement(C,null)};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(r.a.createElement(F,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))}},[[39,1,2]]]);
